Word Guessing Game - WordWizard
This is a simple Python-based word guessing game called WordWizard. The game randomly selects a 5-letter word from a predefined list, and the player has 5 chances to guess the word. After each guess, the player receives feedback on:

Correct letters (letters in the correct position),
Misplaced letters (letters in the word but in the wrong position), and
Incorrect letters (letters not in the word).
The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of turns. It's a fun and educational way to practice vocabulary and logical thinking!
